  You may now be considering if you should use hypnosis to quit smoking. I have help many of our clients become successful with their smoking cessation goals by addressing their individual needs. But now you are standing at a fork in the road of your life. It is up to you do decide if you should continue what you've been doing in regards to continuing to poison your body with cigarettes. Its time to consider all of the concerns that being smoking brings into your life.
</p>

<p>
  The road of being a smoker is a slow downward road. You could just coast down. It's the path of continuing to do what you have been doing for so long. But it's a path of misery it means carrying all the concerns of continuing to smoke longer than you have.
</p>

<p>
  The road of being a non smoker will take a little bit of effort but it is the way to freedom, health and life. It is the road of being in control of your life.

<p>
  Look at the road of being a smoker, it means carrying around with you all of the problems associated with continuing to smoker longer than you already have. Think about how bad being smoking makes you feel. Feel the weight of the burden of this self-destructive behavior. Now you can begin to feel your desire to be free from the ill-affects of this behavior.
<p>

<p>
  You can begin to look down the road of being a smoker for a whole year. There you are after one more year. Another whole year of being out of control. You begin to feel the weight of the disappointment in yourself. You notice the things that little this painful way of living. The cigarette butts, the dirty ashtrays, the smell, cartons and packs of cigarettes, the lost money, lost time. You see the broken promises. The broken promises you made to yourself. Promising to quit. Feeling the frustration of using the wrong tool, will power, stopping for a few days, then lighting up. Wanting to quit be feeling that urge to light up again and again. It's as if there's a mirror there and you can looking in it and ask your self, "Am I pleased with having another year of being a smoker? Do I feel healthier or worse? I am happy with myself for continuing to smoke for one more year?"
</p>

<p>
  Then you look further, five more years of struggling, of being out of control. Five more years of broken promises. Five more years of frustration. You feel all the affects of that choice of being a smoker for five more years. You feel hopeless. Again you look around and see all of the things associated with being a smoker. The ashtrays, the cartons and packs of cigarettes, the cigarette burns, the smell, lost money and time. The frustration of wanting to do something but not knowing how. You look at all these things now and you can't stand the sight of them. These are the things that have done this to you. You may even ask, "Am I please with myself for being a smoker five more years? Do I have the right to do this to myself? Am I healthier for having made this choice? How is it affecting my health. Is my life better or worse?. "
</p>

<p>
  Now you can see yourself after ten more years of being out of control. Brining forth all of the affects of this choice. You look back and you know you promised yourself ten years ago that you would stop smoking. You begin to really feel the frustration of wanting and trying, stopping but lighting up again. You being to really feel the affects of this decision. You look around and again see all the things that litter this road. The ashtrays, cartons and packs, lost time, lost health. You see then and you can't stand the sight of them any more. Look in the mirror there, see your self and ask yourself, "Am I please with being a smoker for ten more painful years? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel smarter?" Really feel the consequences of remaining on this low but easy road.
</p>

<p>
  But now you can feel better because none of that has happened yet, and it doesn't have to. You decide not to let that happen to you. You have decided to take the high road. The high road of living life as a non-smoker. You know that it will take a little bit of work but you now know in your heart and in your mind that it is worth it.
