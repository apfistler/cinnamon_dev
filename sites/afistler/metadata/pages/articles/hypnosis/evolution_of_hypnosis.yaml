        Franz Mesmer was an Austrian physician who developed the theory of "animal magnetism,"
        which later became known as mesmerism. He believed that there was a magnetic force within the body
        that could be manipulated to induce healing. Mesmer's techniques involved passes of his hands or magnets
        over the patient's body to balance their magnetic fluids. Although his methods were controversial and later
        debunked, Mesmer's work contributed to the popularization of hypnotic techniques.
