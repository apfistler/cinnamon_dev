<h2>Cinnamon</h2>

<p>
  In parallel with my web development ventures, the evolution of my own generic static website generation tool, aptly named 'Cinnamon,' unfolded. Initially conceived as a straightforward Python script, 'html_gen.py,' its purpose was simple: amalgamate the main content of an HTML document with a template and menu. This involved basic text replacement, using strings like <!--CONTENT--> and <!--MENU--> in the template.
</p>

<figure class="content-img caption right">

</figure>

<h3>Simple Beginnings</h3>

<p>
  Cinnamon began as a pragmatic solution to streamline content creation, sparing me from the tedious task of duplicating common elements across every HTML page. However, as any seasoned developer can attest, there's no such thing as a throwaway script. Scripts have a tendency to grow and evolve.
</p>

<h3>The Growth of Cinnamon</h3>

<p>
  During a reflective moment on a walk, the name 'Cinnamon' materialized in my mind, and it stuck. As the tool expanded, so did its capabilities. Cinnamon grew to handle multiple sites, diverse templates, and introduced features such as reading configuration YAML files for site information, including name, address data, email, phone numbers, and menu generation data.
</p>

<h3>Handling Complexity with Metadata</h3>

<figure class="content-img caption left">
  <img src="/img/technology/projects/cinnamon_conifg.png" alt="Cinnamon Config File" />
  <figcaption>Snippet of Cinnamon's Configuration File</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  To address the intricacies of site management, I integrated a metadata file for each content HTML page. This file encompasses categories, page title names, keywords, and even manages complex HTML structures. For instance, the articles table on my page is dynamically generated from data in the site's metadata YAML file, allowing for easier maintenance and updates.
</p>

<h3>The Future of Cinnamon</h3>

<p>
  Looking ahead, the future of Cinnamon involves a significant refactor. The goal is to create a system of cascading objects that handle different sites and subsites while abstracting complex HTML structures into repeatable, definable code snippets. This separation of data and design code facilitates easier management and customization.
</p>

<h3>Cascading Sites and Assets</h3>

<p>
  In the envisioned future, Cinnamon will support cascading sites. The master configuration will contain generic metadata information applicable to all pages, along with a catalog of CSS and JavaScript files to be included across the entire site. Each page within the site will have its own metadata file, enabling further customization and overrides.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, the concept of assets will be introduced, allowing for a comprehensive catalog of assets, including CSS, JavaScript, and images. For instance, incorporating an image in any page of the site can be as simple as specifying <!--flower.png caption="Flower" -->, allowing Cinnamon to intelligently locate and include the image.
</p>

<p>
  These advancements aim to streamline and enhance the development process, making the creation and maintenance of websites more intuitive and efficient.
</p>

<h2>Cinnamon: A Glimpse into the Future of My Website Development</h2>
