I have a unique and specialized hypnotic process that doesn.t just give you new techniques to bury your anger, our process releases anger, so you can begin to respond better.
</p>

<h2>I Understand Anger</h2>
<p>
  All feelings are good. Anger is a good feeling. Anger tells us that something isn't fair and to take action to make the situation fair. In fact there have been many good things come as a result of anger. In fact, our country was founded by a group of angry men, who wanted freedom and felt they were being treated unfairly. Anger is a feeling and all feelings are good when they are based in reality.
</p>

<p>
  It is when a feeling isn't based in reality when they begin to cause problems. This can happen with any feeling. For example some people begin to experience feelings of fear that aren't based in reality, so they develop phobias. So now that little spider becomes perceived as a huge threat. This can also happen with anger. Some time long ago, for whatever reason you may have been in a situation where you were treated unfairly and at the time there was nothing you could do about it. Sometimes people remember what it was sometimes they don.t. But over time every time that person got angry it was like pouring that anger into a cup. Every time that person gets angry that cup fills more and more. So every time when that person gets angry that person begins to experience and feel that anger from all those situations in the past where they were anger. So now even in a situation where someone would only be a little bit annoyed, this person feels all that anger from the past as well as the present which causes them to experience it as if the situation was really, really unfair. This is called emotional resonance.
</p>

<p>
  When that person feels that angry, they might explode and yell at that person or do things that they might regret. After the situation passes they make a promise that they will never react that way again. But the next time they get angry, all that anger from the past begins to come up again causing them to react in the same way. Each time it happens they put more and more anger into that cup. This makes it easier for that cup to overflow with just a little provocation.
