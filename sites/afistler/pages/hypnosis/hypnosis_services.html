  incorporating the latest and most advanced hypnosis techniques, 
  this allows me to create lasting change.  Typically the process 
  takes anywhere between 4 to 6 sessions for most issues.  
  Sometimes certain people require additional sessions but this is rare.

  bit of background information about the issue you want to work on. 
  This helps me prepare for the first session.  When you call us,
  we will be happy to explain my process as it relates to your issue, 
  and answer any questions that you may have.

  When you arrive for your first appointment, you will be greeted 
  and be asked to fill out some background information about your 
  issue that will be helpful to your hypnotist.

  that will begin to alter the behavioral aspect of your issue.
