<p>
  Welcome... 
</p>

<p>
  Although it may at first seem too good to be true, 
  hypnosis is a proven prcoess that genuinely works for
  weight loss issues.  But I 
  don't stop there.  I work in a very unique weight control
  management program that you will not find anywhere else. 
</p>

<h2>Weight Loss Is Our Area of Expertise!</h2>

<p>
  The majority of individuals who fail to lose weight do
  so because they try to diet and diets only work for a few days.  
  Forcing yourself to control what you eat only causes frustration.
  And when the frustration sets in, old patterns rear their ugly 
  heads and before long you're back to eating all the wrong foods. 
  With our weight management program, you don't have to struggle
  to gain will power because your own mind supports you in 
  eating correctly.  Without even giving it much thought,
  once you participate, you
  start doing things that your body and mind require
  for weight loss success.  
</p>

<h2>Can Hypnosis Work for Everyone?</h2>

</div>

<p>
  Although hypnosis has proven to be a valuable tool for 
  life-changing results, we have just very recently come to
  understand that direct suggestion hypnosis alone only worked
  for about 10 to 20 % of the people who were being hypnotized. 
  Plus direct suggestion alone was only temporary. 
  Through the use of advanced hypnotic techniques, we are able to 
  resolve the underlying issues, which allows me to have a success
  rate of close to 95%.  Recent technology has brought to 
  light that for lasting change, one must apply a specialized
  treatment for weight loss that blends the old technology of
  direct suggestion with new modalities that first removes the 
  reasons for failure.  In essence, once the underlying issues
  are removed, the mind is more able to readily accept the new input.
  By and large, the more therapeutic approach reduces and eliminates
  the aspects of emotional eating which occurs when you feel bored, 
  anxious, frustrated or depressed.  Emotional eating has nothing
  to do with real hunger.  
</p>

<h2>The Most Sought After Hypnosis Sessions!</h2>

<p>
  During your sessions, 
  we focus on ways that help you react to food in a new way.  
  You gain control over your eating habits and food becomes
  your friend.  Finally your long struggle with food will 
  be over and you'll feel more in control than you ever
  had previously.  Before long you'll be looking in the 
  mirror and wondering whatever happened to that person 
  who had a weight issue.
