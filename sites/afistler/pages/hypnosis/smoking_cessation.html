<p>
  Welcome...
</p>

<p>
  The word 'success' won't even come close to the excitement and powerful transformation 
  you'll experience when you allow hypnosis to help you give up the habit of smoking.  
  Why?  Because hypnosis is a proven process that permanently eliminates the unhealthy
  and unpleasant habit of smoking cigarettes.  Quitting cold turkey or using a patch doesn't 
  work because it only shifts the problem to another area.  Often that area is overeating.  
  I work with a very unique program that you will not find 
  anywhere else.  What makes us different is that I use a method that not only helps you
  eliminate the cause, but I also design a strategy that makes use of your spare time more 
  productively, so you won't gain weight.   I get to the root of the issue so that you give 
  up your addictions permanently.     
</p>

<h2>Will Hypnosis Work For You? </h2>

<p>
  Although hypnosis has proven to work, if you are only attempting hypnosis to please another and are not 
  doing it for yourself, it won't work.  You must be committed to yourself and to the program and really want to 
  give up cigarettes to reach success.  In fact, I have just very recently come to understand that in order for hypnosis to work, 
  it's crucial that a participant must be willing and committed to get to the root of the issue. 
  Direct suggestion hypnosis alone only works for a small number of people.  In order to achieve permanent results, 
  I use a specialized treatment that blends old technology of direct suggestion with 
  a newer and more advanced process that first removes the reasons for smoking.  However, if one isn't 
  ommitted to reaching their goals, it's impossible to make the effective changes.  
</p>

<h2>The Two Types of Smokers!</h2>

</div>

<p>
  There are two types of smokers, each requiring a different type of plans.  The first is a Casual Smoker.  
  These are the people who smoke only occasionally and have been smoking for less than ten years.  More often than not,
  these individuals simply need help with the behavioral aspect of smoking and only require very short-term treatment.  
  The second type of smoker is the Regular Smoker.  They are the people who have been smoking for a long while 
  and smoke on a daily basis.  Generally speaking they are the smokers who become irritated, angry, stressed or
  frustrated when they can't smoke.  Treatment for Regular Smokers may require approximately six sessions to see results.  
  But by blending the old technology of direct suggestion with the newer modalities that first removes the reasons for the poor habit, 
  I are now able to resolve the underlying issue in both situations with a success rate of close to 95%.

<h2>Are You Ready To Change Your Life Through Our Powerful Process?</h2>
 
<p>
  If you've come to a place in your life where you recognize how important it is to take care of your health but you 
  have trouble giving up cigarettes, hypnosis is the answer. If you.re tired of the embarrassment of being a smoker, 
  sick of the odor of stale smoke on your clothes and fed up with worrying about your health, perhaps your time has
  come to take control of this terrible habit.  Did you know that when you reach for a cigarette, very often it's
  really a craving for something else?  I at the Baltimore Hypnosis Center help you learn what it is you really want, 
  and what your feelings are trying to tell you.  I get to the heart of the smoking habit by severing the mental 
  and emotional ties that cause a person to smoke.  Once these ties are severed, the cravings for a cigarette fade
  and you're on your way to being a non-smoker.  Stop fighting with yourself to keep away from the cigarettes; 
  let us help you stop the urge to smoke.  
</p>

<h2>Gain Control Over Your Habit!</h2>

<p>
  I am very different than other hypnotist in that I offer a custom designed 
  program that helps you react to a bad habit in a new way.  I do not use a hit or miss approach and hope that it works.  
  Instead I work closely with each client, designing a customized program and determining what the desired outcome will be.  
  If you're ready to start life anew, I are ready to help you get there.  By eliminating the cause of the problem,
  the old behavior will not return.  Why not give us the opportunity to help you create a life that is more 
  satisfying than you ever thought possible.  Call me today at #{{data.phone}} and let's schedule your appointments 
  so that you can start taking control over your habit and give up smoking for good.
